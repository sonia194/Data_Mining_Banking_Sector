# Data_Mining_Banking_Sector
Despite of numerous studies that have provided important insights into the direct marketing, the understanding of this topic of growing interest and importance still remains deficient. Therefore, in this project we used the EDA processing and data mining method to build a predictive model for a Portuguese bank to provide the necessary suggestion for marketing campaign team in order to target a specific category of customer which is more susceptible to subscribe to the new product as well the term deposit.

A lot of thank you to Cedric Joel
